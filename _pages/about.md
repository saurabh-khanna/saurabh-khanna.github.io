I am an Assistant Professor of Communication Science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/s.khanna/s.khanna.html), and a Research Fellow at the [University of Oxford](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/person/dr-saurabh-khanna) [Pembroke College]. I lead research at [theinvisiblelab.org](https://theinvisiblelab.org/) where we leverage machine learning and information retrieval to study both the diversity and the limits of human knowledge in an increasingly digitized world. A selection of ongoing projects include:

- Developing methods to theorize, quantify, and boost [invisible information](https://theinvisiblelab.org/)
- [PictoPercept](https://pictopercept.streamlit.app/): Capturing invisible biases through pairwise visual wikisurveys
- [Lost Without Translation](https://invisiblelang.streamlit.app/): Estimation and implications of invisible languages on the Internet
- [Shadowbans](https://github.com/theinvisiblelab/shadowbans): Computational prediction of shadowbans and their implications
- [Beyond Words](https://theinvisiblelab.org/): Communication beyond the human species

I received my PhD in Education Policy [minor in Computer Science] from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I was a Human-centered AI Fellow, a Stanford Data Science Scholar, and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow. My prior background spans Computer Science Engineering [BITS Pilani], Economics [Stanford], and Education [TISS]. More <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Saurabh_Khanna.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am fond of exploring unorthodox films from diverse cultures, plant-based cooking experiments, and playing sidekick to <a href="/assets/img/coffee.jpeg" target="_blank">this angel</a>.
