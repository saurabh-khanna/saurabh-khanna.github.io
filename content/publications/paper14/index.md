##### Abstract

This dataset contains detailed records of public installations of open-source software entities maintained in collaboration with the Public Knowledge Project - Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and Open Preprint Systems (OJS). OJS, for instance, currently enables peer-reviewed research by more than 52000 multilingual journals, largely hosted in the Global South. We release an updated dataset annualy. This dataset is now being ingested by scientometric databases such as Google Scholar and OpenAlex to improve the discoverability of research published beyond traditional Eurocentric commercial publishing channels.
