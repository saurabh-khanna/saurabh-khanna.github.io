summary: "Educational technology is ubiquitous, and educational technology interventions often target literacy. However, there is insufficient information about the effects of these interventions on literacy outcomes in elementary school. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of quasi-experimental and experimental studies published between 2010 and 2023 that evaluated the effects of educational technology interventions on the literacy outcomes of K–5 students. The meta-analysis across 119 studies from 105 manuscripts revealed positive effects for decoding (0.33), language comprehension (0.30), reading comprehension (0.23), and writing proficiency (0.81). However, when isolating effects for standardized measures, effects for decoding (0.23), language comprehension (0.12), reading comprehension (0.14), and writing proficiency (0.34) were reduced. Moderator analyses suggested that effects can depend on outcome, intervention, and participant characteristics. In the discussion, we describe and contextualize findings and call for more research to further unpack moderator effects. We also discuss possible implications for practice and policy."

##### Abstract

Educational technology is ubiquitous, and educational technology interventions often target literacy. However, there is insufficient information about the effects of these interventions on literacy outcomes in elementary school. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of quasi-experimental and experimental studies published between 2010 and 2023 that evaluated the effects of educational technology interventions on the literacy outcomes of K–5 students. The meta-analysis across 119 studies from 105 manuscripts revealed positive effects for decoding (0.33), language comprehension (0.30), reading comprehension (0.23), and writing proficiency (0.81). However, when isolating effects for standardized measures, effects for decoding (0.23), language comprehension (0.12), reading comprehension (0.14), and writing proficiency (0.34) were reduced. Moderator analyses suggested that effects can depend on outcome, intervention, and participant characteristics. In the discussion, we describe and contextualize findings and call for more research to further unpack moderator effects. We also discuss possible implications for practice and policy.
