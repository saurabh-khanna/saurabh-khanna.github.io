#### About This Book

*Machine Learning for Communication Scientists* is an open-source web book designed to introduce machine learning concepts, methods, and applications specifically tailored for researchers and practitioners in communication science.

The book bridges the gap between technical machine learning literature and the practical needs of communication researchers, providing accessible explanations, real-world examples, and hands-on tutorials.

#### Key Topics

+ Foundations of machine learning for social science research
+ Text analysis and natural language processing
+ Image and video analysis for communication research
+ Network analysis and recommendation systems
+ Ethical considerations in computational communication research
+ Practical implementation with Python and R

---

#### Why This Book

Machine learning is increasingly central to communication research, but existing resources often assume extensive programming or mathematical backgrounds. This book:

+ Uses communication research examples throughout
+ Emphasizes practical application over mathematical theory
+ Provides reproducible code and datasets
+ Addresses ethical and methodological considerations specific to communication science
+ Is freely available and community-driven
