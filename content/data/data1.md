## Data Sources

Research projects often utilize:

+ Social media data (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook)
+ Educational assessment data
+ Digital analytics and web data
+ Survey and experimental data
+ Text corpora and linguistic datasets

*Note: Specific datasets are shared alongside publications when permitted by data sharing agreements and IRB protocols.*

## Using Research Code

Most research code is provided in Python and R. Basic workflow:

### Python Environment Setup

```python
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv research_env
source research_env/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Analyses

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from research_tools import analysis

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data/research_data.csv')

# Run analysis
results = analysis.run_analysis(data)
```
